  "Evaluate BODY with silenced output.

While BODY is evaluated, all output is redirected to a buffer.
This affects:

- `message'
- All functions using `standard-output' (e.g. `print', `princ', etc.)

Inside BODY, the buffer is bound to the lexical variable
`shut-up-sink'.  Additionally provide a lexical function
`shut-up-current-output', which returns the current contents of
`shut-up-sink' when called with no arguments."
